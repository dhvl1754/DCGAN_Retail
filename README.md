# DCGAN_Retail

This project aims to design and implement an advanced GAN model using DCGAN architecture to generate high-quality images for retail applications (e.g., product images for Safeway's online catalog). Our goal is to achieve a notable increase in image quality to support marketing and customer engagement.

## Project Objectives
- Develop a DCGAN model to create high-quality retail images.
- Increase image quality by 40% to enhance product visualization.
- Deploy the model using Docker for easy scalability.
